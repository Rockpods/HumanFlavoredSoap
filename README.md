# HumanFlavoredSoap
A simple Proxy I am making that can be used on HTML. You can deploy in Repl.it, or any web hosting site you want.</br>
I do not know very much about coding and stuff so if anyone is willing to help message me on Discord: Rockpods #1744</br>
If you do not need a super tiny website and to get features first try Meatball Flavored Ice Cream</br>
